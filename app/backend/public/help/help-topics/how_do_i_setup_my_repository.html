    <span>What do you need?</span>
  </h1>
  <p>
    <span>Navigate to config/project-pipelines.yaml and add a new entry under <strong>availableProjects</strong> with
      unique code as the key and then Project Properties as described below:</span>
  </p>
  <h2> Project properties </h2>
  <p>
    <span>Projects’ configuration is saved into the </span>
    <strong>project-pipelines.yaml</strong>
    <span>&nbsp;file which can be found in the </span>
    <strong>config</strong>
    <span>&nbsp;folder. All available projects are currently saved under </span>
    <strong>availableProjects</strong>
    <span>&nbsp;object/array.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Each project consists of a </span>
    <strong>key (unique code) </span>
      <span>&nbsp;and </strong>
    <strong>four</strong>
    <span>&nbsp;properties as described below:</span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>name</strong>
      <span>: This is a name you choose for your project, and can be anything! We only use it to make it easy for you to
        distinguish between other projects.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>files</strong>
      <span>: This is where you will configure and tell the system where to get the files from. Currently it supports
      </span>
      <strong>BitBucket</strong>
      <span>&nbsp;version control (vc) and the plan is to expand and support others like SVN, GitHub, … etc. <br />To
        learn how to configure your repository please visit the correspondent help file here: <br />- BitBucket: </span>

        do I configure my BitBucket repository?</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>docker</strong>
      <span>: We run each project inside a Docker container so we can build the artifacts almost identical to how you’d
        build them in your environment. And to do this we’ll need a Docker image and the commands you need to run to
        build your artifact..</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>remote</strong>
      <span>: This currently supports only FTP but the idea, again, is to expand the support to more protocols like
        SFTP, Local zip files, Cloud hosting, … etc..</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

          <strong>NOTE:</strong> Please remember NOT to commit any of your project values back to your repository. Soon
          I’ll be releasing an update where projects configuration is moved to a yaml file (just like bitbucket-pipelies
          and hopefully I’ll find the time to secure the app behind some authentication so no need to have config files
          that hold sensitive information.
